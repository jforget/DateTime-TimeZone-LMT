INSTALLATION:
=============

Use CPAN, CPANPLUS or CPANMINUS - there's no config in the process that requires you to
do anything strange.

For those of you who like it the manual way, the recipe is the same as normal:
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.

This module contains no XS code and thus should install anywhere.
